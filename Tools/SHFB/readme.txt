This folder contains 3 addons to Sandcastle Helpfile Builder that we use to produce the X# documentation:
- XSharpVs has the presentation style
- XSharpSyntax has the code to produce X# style syntax on the topic pages
- XSharpPlugin is a plugin that "post processes" the generated topic pages. It changes METHOD into FUNCTION when relevant and also renames __Usual to USUAL etc.

XSharpVs needs to be deployed to the Sandcastle PresentationStyles folder
The other components need to be desployed to the Sandcastle main folder
