Steps to create a new XSharp build
===================================
- Check in the source code to the Compiler (the Dev Folder). Don't forget to increase the version numbers
  (COmpiler solution, Solution Items folder). Change the numbers and other relevant info, such as Copyright Year in   
   x Buildnumber.h
   x Constants.cs
- Open an Admin VS command prompt in the Dev\XSharp Folder and run the Rebuild.cmd to build a debug and release version of the compiler 
  and the other tools in the Compiler solution. This also deploys the CodeAnalysis and CodeGenerator DLLs in the DevPublic\External folder
  The output for the Release build is in the c:\XSharp\Dev\XSharp\artifacts\bin\xsc\Release\net472 folder. 
  The debug build in the c:\XSharp\Dev\XSharp\artifacts\bin\xsc\Debug\net472 folder.
- Check in the source code for the VS Integration (The DevPublic folder). Don't forget to increase the version numbers 
  (VSIntegration solution, Solution Items folder). Change the numbers and other relevant info such as Copyright in
  x Buildnumber.h
  x Constants.cs  
- Build a release version of this solution and also the tools solution by calling Build Release
  The output appears in the c:\XSharp\DevPublic\Binaries\Release folder.
- Check in the files for the VS Integration and Tools
- Update the documentation and version numbers in Help And Manual (Both a version number and a text variable)
- Run the publish tasks inside by calling createhelp.cmd in this folder.
  The output should appear in the c:\XSharp\Dev\XSharp\Binaries\Help folder
- Adjust the Readme and What's New files for the installer. 
  You can copy the new items for the What's new page from the helpfile. 
  You may have to change some styles in the RTF file.
- Check in the Help Source files 
- The Installer is in the DevIntern repo. This is an internal repo because it also 
  has our private keyfiles and the keys to sign the EXE files.
- Open the c:\XSharp\DevIntern\src\Setup\XSharpSetup.iss file in Inno Setup
- Adjust version number, dates and times and output exe name in the installer script
- Build for Fox
- When needed also build for Public
- Inno calls 2 command line tools. 1 to add the Help files to a CAB file so they can be signed The other tool 
  patches the vsixmanifest files so they have the same version as the installer.
- The output goes to c:\XSharp\DevIntern\Binaries\Setup    
- Test the installers on a virtual machine. At least test an update from a previous build as well as a complete new install.
- Test on a machine with VS 2015, VS 2017 and both. Info should display correctly in Help About and Tools - Extensions
- Try to create a new X# Project and build and debug it.
- Check in the Setup Source files 
- If all works, then deploy the setup files to the website in a ZIP
- Set RsFiles information on the website, including version number, description, image etc
- Announce new build on website, Facebook, Twitter etc
- Start Facebook add campaign when needed
- Create a tag in Github for the private and public repo.
- Merge the Compiler and VSIntegration branches into their master branches
- Update the what's new document on the website.
