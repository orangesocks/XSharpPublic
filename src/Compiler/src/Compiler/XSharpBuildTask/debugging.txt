To debug a MsBuild script you can use 2 tricks:

1) Create a preprocessed output file
   msbuild /pp:Preprocessed.xml Project.xsproj

   This shows all included targets files and their paths
   
   You can call MsBuild with the preprocessed file if you want: msbuild Preprocessed.Xml
   This gives a line/column info that may help to determine the problem
   
2) MsBuild file logging
   msbuild Project.xsproj  /fl1 /flp1:Verbosity=Diagnostic
   
To open our XSharp.Build assembly in the debugger, set an environment variable:

SET MSBUILDDEBUGONSTART=1
