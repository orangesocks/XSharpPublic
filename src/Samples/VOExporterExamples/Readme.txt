This folder structure contains the examples from the chapters in the documentation about migrating Visual Objects apps to X#.
The Before folder contains the unchanged source produced by VOXPorter.
The After folder contains the changed code that was produced with the instructions in the documentation.

Note:
The examples use Image files and Data Files from the Visual Objects installation. 
On our machine that was the folder C:\Cavo28SP3. 
If your Visual Objects installation is in a different folder then you may want to adjust the paths in the PRG and RC files.
If you follow the examples and convert the code yourself then this will not be a problem because the files will be in 
the correct Visual Objects location on your machine.
