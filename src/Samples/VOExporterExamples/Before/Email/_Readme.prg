This sample uses the Internet Classes Version from Sven Ebert,
which are compatible to VO 2.6 version and adds many
missing features and corrects a lot of bugs of the VO 2.7a version.
The new classes supports now an advanced storage management of
EMails, which uses streaming methods to receive and send emails.
As a result of this you have no memory problems with extra large
emails. This sample uses a lot of the new features of this classes.
Also you can see how to implement a progressbar for receiving and sending
emails.

Addtionally you can see how to use new custom drawing feature and
the usage of the new owneralignment stuff.
