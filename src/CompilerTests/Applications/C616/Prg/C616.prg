// 616. error XS0030: Cannot convert type 'void' to 'TestStruc'
/*
	PtrToStructure() has 4 overloads:

	STATIC METHOD PtrToStructure(@@ptr AS IntPtr, @@structure AS OBJECT) AS VOID
	STATIC METHOD PtrToStructure<T>(@@ptr AS IntPtr, @@structure AS T) AS VOID
	STATIC METHOD PtrToStructure(@@ptr AS IntPtr, structureType AS Type) AS OBJECT
	STATIC METHOD PtrToStructure(@@ptr AS IntPtr) AS T
	
	When using 
	
	Marshal.PtrToStructure(p,TypeOf(TestStruc))
	
the compiler incorrectly picks the "OBJECT" overload, instead of the "Type" one.

RvdH 20180710 in fact: it did not pick the one with OBJECT but the generic one
