// 621. Problems with same named functions and methods
/*
Compile reports several warnings like:

warning XS9043: Method 'Left' is ambiguous. Could be 'TestClass.Left(string, int)' or 'Functions.Left(string, int)'. Using the first one.

This is not correct, the function should be always used, not the same named static method.
Indeed at teh runtime the static method is (incorrectly) called.
