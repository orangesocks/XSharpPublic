This sample demonstrates some of the new window styles and controls such as:

- the PushLike window style for RadioButtons and CheckBoxes (pizza size)
- the Image property for PushButtons and CheckBoxes (toppings, selection)
- the use of extended styles such as StaticEdge (Fixed Text controls)
- the use of the new ProgressBar control (Deliver Dialog)
- the use of the new Spinner control (crust size)
- the Flat window style for buttons (Mario)
- the Number only window style for edit controls (crust size, phone number)

It also shows how to derive a new class from PushButton in order to implement
a button with showing to different bitmaps depending on its pressed state.

Finally it is an example for a dialog only application in Visual Objects.
