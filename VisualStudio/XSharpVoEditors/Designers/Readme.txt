This project has been compiled in the Vulcan Dialect because it uses some functions from XSharp.RT to create DBF files and indexes.
We have chosen the vulcan dialect because the project uses single quoted char literals and in the VO dialect we would have needed to prefix
these literals with a 'c' character.
