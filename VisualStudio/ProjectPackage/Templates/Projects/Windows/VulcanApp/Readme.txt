This "Bring Your Own Runtime" (BYOR) example shows how you can use vulcan Datatypes 
and functions in X#.
The example does NOT come with the Vulcan Runtime DLLs. You need to have these installed
on your machine and you may need to update the references in the example and point them
to the Vulcan Runtime DLLs on your machine.
